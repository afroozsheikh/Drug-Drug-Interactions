# Drug-Drug-Interactions
The reaction between two or more drugs (drug-drug interaction) or between a drug and a sepecific food (drug-food interaction) is called a
drug interaction. This phenomenon can have threatening side effects on body and it may also make your medication stop working, become less effective, or too strong. Therefore learning about drug interactions and avoiding them plays a critical role in everyoneâ€™s health
## Dataset
I will use the [ogbl-ddi](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-ddi) dataset which is a homogeneous, unweighted, undirected graph, representing the drug-drug interaction network. Each node represents an FDA-approved or experimental drug. Edges represent interactions between drugs and can be interpreted as a phenomenon where the joint effect of taking the two drugs together is considerably different from the expected effect in which drugs act independently of each other.
